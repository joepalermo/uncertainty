# uncertainty

This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms that enable modelling uncertainty, and a 
pipeline for running active learning experiments. 

The following algorithms are implemented:

* Bayesian linear regression
* Gaussian process regression
* Monte Carlo dropout networks
